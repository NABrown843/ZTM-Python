# ZTM-Python
 Zero To Mastery: Complete Python Developer
 
 Using course to familiarize myself Python 3 after being primarily a .NET dev. Also first time using Linux for any length of time (using Colt Steele course as well to see which I prefer)

 Section 1 - Introduction  
 Section 2 - Python Introduction  
 
 Day 1 thoughts: Hard to say if I like Colt or Andrei better yet.  Andrei does mention using an IDE/Editor, but suggests teaching the basics on a web-based editor, replit.com.  Interesting tool that I wasn't aware of, but I think I prefer Colt's method of actually using Sublime Text from the get go.  This may not be a 100% fair assessment as Colt also uses a web-based editor housed in Udemy's site for some basic exercises as well.  There was around an hour between the first two sections that didn't really start any actual programming outside of a basic input/print to show how it works.  I don't fault the course for this as it's meant for complete beginners.  Overall, both seem like good courses, but I like the aspect of this course building projects and focusing on a portfolio.  Can't speak to the actual Python content lessons yet, but first impression is this course helps users get noticed a little more with the portfolio, discord job listings, LinkedIn group, etc.  To be continued when I actually start the basics.

 Section 3 - Python Basics (started)  
 
 Day 2 thoughts: Andrei seems to be teaching a little faster than Colt.  It hasn't been an issue more me yet with some previous coding experience, but I wonder if a beginner would get stuck.  He does teach well, so perhaps not and I think he is just trying to get the "need to knows" out of the way so we can do some exercises/projects which I appreciate.  Overall, I'm enjoying the course so far, but it's hard to say if I will feel like a proficient Python dev afterwards yet.
