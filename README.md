# ZTM-Python
 Zero To Mastery: Complete Python Developer
 
 Using course to familiarize myself Python 3 after being primarily a .NET dev. Also first time using Linux for any length of time (using Colt Steele course as well to see which I prefer)

 Section 1 - Introduction  
 Section 2 - Python Introduction  
 
 Day 1 thoughts: Hard to say if I like Colt or Andrei better yet.  Andrei does mention using an IDE/Editor, but suggests teaching the basics on a web-based editor, replit.com.  Interesting tool that I wasn't aware of, but I think I prefer Colt's method of actually using Sublime Text from the get go.  This may not be a 100% fair assessment as Colt also uses a web-based editor housed in Udemy's site for some basic exercises as well.  There was around an hour between the first two sections that didn't really start any actual programming outside of a basic input/print to show how it works.  I don't fault the course for this as it's meant for complete beginners.  Overall, both seem like good courses, but I like the aspect of this course building projects and focusing on a portfolio.  Can't speak to the actual Python content lessons yet, but first impression is this course helps users get noticed a little more with the portfolio, discord job listings, LinkedIn group, etc.  To be continued when I actually start the basics.

 Section 3 - Python Basics (started)  
 
 Day 2 thoughts: Andrei seems to be teaching a little faster than Colt.  It hasn't been an issue more me yet with some previous coding experience, but I wonder if a beginner would get stuck.  He does teach well, so perhaps not and I think he is just trying to get the "need to knows" out of the way so we can do some exercises/projects which I appreciate.  Overall, I'm enjoying the course so far, but it's hard to say if I will feel like a proficient Python dev afterwards yet.

 Section 3 - Python Basics (finished)  
 
 Day 3 thoughts: I'm moving through pretty fast (2x speed on videos), so it seems like there is a lot to take in.  Concepts are familiar, but methods/syntax are obviously different.  Not difficult yet, but I'm hoping going through this fast will still allow it to stick enough that I can do some of the upcoming exercises or exercises in Ardit Sulce's 100 Python Problems course (starting in conjunction with this course after finishing Section 5: Developer Environment) without having to reference too much.  The exercises sprinkled in are going well, but I am ready to work on an actual problem.  Not a fault of the course, it's markets as Zero/Beginner, so I understand crawling->walking->running->to the moon?  Looking forward to starting Python Basics 2 tomorrow where we'll get into some of the usual suspects like loops, conditional logic, etc.

 Section 4 - Python Basics (begin)  
 
 Day 4 thoughts: Getting into conditional logic, loops, and functions now.  Enjoying the course and the fact that Andrei promotes searching for answers on your own for some things.  The lack of parentheses and semi-colons is hard to get used to, but other than that, things are still going well.  Looking forward to more exercises.

 Section 4 - Python Basics(finished)  
 
 Day 5 thoughts: Finished the Python basics sections and took the tests.  Did well on the tests/problems that I had encountered so far, but the second did have some that are taught in Advanced Python and I had no idea how to do them in Python.  Overall, feeling pretty good about the course.  Looking forward to getting my environment set up and getting into the advanced python sections.

 Section 5 - Developer Environment
 
 Day 6 thoughts: Finished the developer environment section and installed VS Code, PyCharm, and Jupyter Notebooks.  I primarily code in C#, so I'm familiar with VS and have done some JavaScript/websites with VS Code, so I'm familiar with it.  PyCharm was created by JetBrains.  I've used their .NET IDE, Rider, so this is also pretty familiar.  Lastly, I've used Jupyter Notebooks in a class for school, but admittedly, I'm not fluent with it.  It will be good to learn more with this when we get to the Machine Learning/Data Science portion of the course.  So, since I'm somewhat familiar with all of these tools, this should have been easy right?  Well, again my lack of experience with Linux has reared it's head and I had some trouble with the installs.  Particularly, after installing Anaconda, I did not see the navigator...spoiler alert...you open it through the terminal.  Not complaining, just wondering when using the terminal for most things will feel normal.  I like using it, just haven't got to the point that it feels easier than using the GUI.  Looking forward to starting the Advanced Python: OOP section tomorrow.  I've been a .NET developer for almost 5 years at this point, but I've never gone through a structured lesson plan for development, so I'm hoping there will be things I learn or things that will make be a better engineer as I continue through this.  I have the suspicion that there are holes in my knowledge and things I could be doing better as far as OOP goes, so I'm excited to get started with this.
