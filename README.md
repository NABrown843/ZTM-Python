# ZTM-Python
 Zero To Mastery: Complete Python Developer  
 
 Using course to familiarize myself Python 3 after being primarily a .NET dev. Also first time using Linux for any length of time (using Colt Steele course as well to see which I prefer)

 Section 1 - Introduction  
 Section 2 - Python Introduction  
 
 Day 1 thoughts: Hard to say if I like Colt or Andrei better yet.  Andrei does mention using an IDE/Editor, but suggests teaching the basics on a web-based editor, replit.com.  Interesting tool that I wasn't aware of, but I think I prefer Colt's method of actually using Sublime Text from the get go.  This may not be a 100% fair assessment as Colt also uses a web-based editor housed in Udemy's site for some basic exercises as well.  There was around an hour between the first two sections that didn't really start any actual programming outside of a basic input/print to show how it works.  I don't fault the course for this as it's meant for complete beginners.  Overall, both seem like good courses, but I like the aspect of this course building projects and focusing on a portfolio.  Can't speak to the actual Python content lessons yet, but first impression is this course helps users get noticed a little more with the portfolio, discord job listings, LinkedIn group, etc.  To be continued when I actually start the basics.

 Section 3 - Python Basics (started)  
 
 Day 2 thoughts: Andrei seems to be teaching a little faster than Colt.  It hasn't been an issue more me yet with some previous coding experience, but I wonder if a beginner would get stuck.  He does teach well, so perhaps not and I think he is just trying to get the "need to knows" out of the way so we can do some exercises/projects which I appreciate.  Overall, I'm enjoying the course so far, but it's hard to say if I will feel like a proficient Python dev afterwards yet.

 Section 3 - Python Basics (finished)  
 
 Day 3 thoughts: I'm moving through pretty fast (2x speed on videos), so it seems like there is a lot to take in.  Concepts are familiar, but methods/syntax are obviously different.  Not difficult yet, but I'm hoping going through this fast will still allow it to stick enough that I can do some of the upcoming exercises or exercises in Ardit Sulce's 100 Python Problems course (starting in conjunction with this course after finishing Section 5: Developer Environment) without having to reference too much.  The exercises sprinkled in are going well, but I am ready to work on an actual problem.  Not a fault of the course, it's markets as Zero/Beginner, so I understand crawling->walking->running->to the moon?  Looking forward to starting Python Basics 2 tomorrow where we'll get into some of the usual suspects like loops, conditional logic, etc.
 
 # 1/18/2022
 Section 4 - Python Basics (begin)  
 
 Day 4 thoughts: Getting into conditional logic, loops, and functions now.  Enjoying the course and the fact that Andrei promotes searching for answers on your own for some things.  The lack of parentheses and semi-colons is hard to get used to, but other than that, things are still going well.  Looking forward to more exercises.

 Section 4 - Python Basics(finished)  
 
 Day 5 thoughts: Finished the Python basics sections and took the tests.  Did well on the tests/problems that I had encountered so far, but the second did have some that are taught in Advanced Python and I had no idea how to do them in Python.  Overall, feeling pretty good about the course.  Looking forward to getting my environment set up and getting into the advanced python sections.  
 
 # 1/20/2022
 Section 5 - Developer Environment  
 
 Day 6 thoughts: Finished the developer environment section and installed VS Code, PyCharm, and Jupyter Notebooks.  I primarily code in C#, so I'm familiar with VS and have done some JavaScript/websites with VS Code, so I'm familiar with it.  PyCharm was created by JetBrains.  I've used their .NET IDE, Rider, so this is also pretty familiar.  Lastly, I've used Jupyter Notebooks in a class for school, but admittedly, I'm not fluent with it.  It will be good to learn more with this when we get to the Machine Learning/Data Science portion of the course.  So, since I'm somewhat familiar with all of these tools, this should have been easy right?  Well, again my lack of experience with Linux has reared it's head and I had some trouble with the installs.  Particularly, after installing Anaconda, I did not see the navigator...spoiler alert...you open it through the terminal.  Not complaining, just wondering when using the terminal for most things will feel normal.  I like using it, just haven't got to the point that it feels easier than using the GUI.  Looking forward to starting the Advanced Python: OOP section tomorrow.  I've been a .NET developer for almost 5 years at this point, but I've never gone through a structured lesson plan for development, so I'm hoping there will be things I learn or things that will make be a better engineer as I continue through this.  I have the suspicion that there are holes in my knowledge and things I could be doing better as far as OOP goes, so I'm excited to get started with this.  
 
 # 1/23/2022
 Section 6 - Advanced Python: Object Oriented Programming  
 
 Day 7 thoughts: Missed a couple of days of coding due to being on the go most of the past two days.  I should be able to get a little more in over the next couple of days, so it should shake out.  Finished the section on OOP and found there were some things that were explained that I have been using, but gained a better understanding of.  This type of learning is exactly why I wanted to take this course from beginning to end (learning Python was a bonus).  I'm hoping as I continue on, that understanding/learning won't be lost and will continue to be solidified.  So far, Andrei has been a good instructor, so I assume that the course will continue to build on itself and fully ingrain the material.  Possibly going a little too fast with 2x speed, but so far, I'm still tracking with the material, most likely due to experience even if I didn't understand the nuances completely the way they are being broken down.  Coming from .NET with some experience with Java and C++, I'm used to being able to declare public and private variables/methods, so losing that ability with Python is something I believe I will miss, but perhaps not.  Old habits and all that.  Continuing the quest tomorrow!

 Section 7 - Advanced Python: Functional Programming  

 Day 8 thoughts: This went through a few useful Python functions and went over Lambda expressions and comprehensions.  Funny story about Lambda Expressions.  In my first "real" technical interview, I was asked if I knew what lambda expressions were.  I was fairly new to programming and had only picked up some things from my then current job.  I got lambdas and deltas mixed up *face_palm* (they're both greek letters, right?!!)  When I answered of course I knew what lambdas were, they asked me to show an example.  It was at this moment that I realized my mistake.  As you may have surmised, the interview only went down hill from here because I felt like an idiot and I did not get the job.  Anyway, I can now confidently say I know was lambda expressions are...I mean, I've used them since in my job, but still, nice to have the background and the section completion to prove it!  Anyway, course still going great.  Learning a lot.  Hoping to go through a few sections tomorrow since they are pretty small.  

# 1/25/2022  
Section 8 - Advanced Python: Decorators  
Section 9 - Advanced Python: Error Handling  
Section 10 - Advanced Python: Generators (Coursework)  

Day 9 thoughts:  Today I learned a lot that I didn't previously know.  I've working with error handling, but never with decorators or generators.  Very cool information.  The Fibonacci lesson was really cool because I know that does come up in interviews.  The next step in the course is to take a couple of tests on Python to test my understanding and then there are 100 problems to work through.  I'm hoping I can move through these pretty quickly without an issue, but it will be a test of how well I've absorbed the information for sure.  I'm looking forward to it.

Section 10 - Quizzes and Problems 1-6  
Section 11 - Modules In Python (Begin)  

Day 10 thoughts:  I took the quizzes and did fairly well on both.  In the first quiz, I did get a little mixed up with some functions from C# vs Python, but overall it went pretty well.  I'd have to continue playing with it before I tried to get any certification or anything, but I don't think it would take very long to feel confident with that.  Andrei has the 100 problems split into 24 days.  I did day 1 and started day 2.  Day 1 went well, but I noticed I wasn't in problem solving mode and was drifting a bit with day 2, so I stopped and am going to continue tomorrow to make sure my head is in it and I'm giving it my best effort.  No point in doing this if I'm not committed.  I continued the learning in Section 11 after the problems.  Got to get into PyCharm a little bit.  I've used IntelliJ and Rider in the past, so this is familiar.  Using packages and imports is pretty straight-forward and what I'm used to, so all is good with that.  I did enjoy playing with some of the built in packages and building the random guessing game.  Once again, pretty similar, but it gets me more familiar with how I'm using Python and continuing to use the terminal and sys.args.  Still enjoying the course and looking forward to finishing section 11 and getting through section 12 and 13 tomorrow.  

# 1/27/2022  
Section 10 - Problems 7-10  
Section 11 - Modules In Python (Finished)  

 Day 11 thoughts: "The best laid plans of mice and men often go awry" as they say. I was hoping to get through section 13, but only had time to complete section 11.  Got into public packages and installing through pip and PyCharm, so that's pretty cool.  I've heard a lot about numpy, pandas, and TensorFlow, so I'm sure some experimentation with them will be in my future.  My head was a little more in the game on the problems that I did and I enjoyed them, I just didn't have the time to go through more than I did.  I would love to get through a few sections tomorrow, but I'm not going to commit because that didn't work out so well for me today.  I am committed to at least doing some, but unsure how much.  Still enjoying the course and work.  

 # 1/28/2022  
 Section 12 - Debugging in Python  
 Section 13 - File I/O  

 Day 12 thoughts:  Got through section 12 and 13 today.  Not as much as I wanted to, but still a good bit.  Learned about PDB in python debugging.  I am fairly used to IntelliSense with Visual Studio and the debugger in IntelliJ/Rider, so I think I will prefer using PyCharm and break points.  He didn't mention breakpoints, so I'm just hopeful that's a thing with PyCharm (TBD).  File I/O was fun, but the Japanese translator errored out because Windows didn't want to write Japanese to a text file.  Guess I'll have to go back to Linux after all.  Hopefully going to get a little more done tomorrow.  

 # 1/29/2022  
 Section 14 - Regular Expressions  
 Section 15 - Testing In Python  
 Section 16 - Career Of A Python Developer  
 Section 17 - Scripting With Python (Begin)  

 Day 13 thoughts:  Got through a good bit today.  I haven't spent a lot of time with RegEx, so it was nice to get a little better understanding of this tool.  I plan to spend some more time with this and use it more in my day to day work where I can.  I'm familiar with UnitTests and have used them for certain projects in the past.  To be completely candid, there are some projects that I haven't used them professionally.  I should probably commit more time to this practice for all projects.  For the career of a Python developer, I'm somewhat familiar with these paths.  After 5 years as a "Fullstack" engineer, I think it would be hard to pivot to some of these without getting inside of a company that utilizes and slowly transitioning.  Not saying that's a goal, just a thought.  I will primarily use Python for backend or scripting purposes, but I'd love to dive more into Machine Learning as time goes on.  For the scripting section, I really just started it.  Learned a little bit about image processing which was pretty cool.  Looking forward to continuing this section tomorrow and getting some actual python projects under my belt.

 Section 17 - Scripting With Python (JPGtoPNG Converter)  

 Day 14 thoughts: I was able to go through the project with a bit of googling on things we haven't covered, but overall, fairly easy project.  I love that every lesson usually has at least some new concept to add to the toolbox.  I didn't get much done beyond this project today, but I watched Andrei's videos on Git.  I usually use GitHub Desktop, but it's nice to be able to use the command line for some of these changes.  Working on a team that utilizes Microsoft stacks, I'm used to using Team Foundation Server as source control, but I'd like to continue learning how powerful Git is to eventually branch into contributing to open source projects and building a strong personal portfolio.  Luckily contributing to open source and building a portfolio website are included in this course, so built in achievements!

 Section 17 - Scriptin with Python (PDF Watermarker)  

 Day 15 thoughts:  I created the PDF Watermarker project today.  I went a little offscript from Andrei by allowing it to pass in specific file paths and pull all files in the path for the watermark.  Took me a second because I made a mistake with the open syntax, but once I figured that out, it was smooth sailing.  I'd really like to finish this section and the scraping data with Python section tomorrow, so I'm hoping that's doable.  If so, I'm hoping to finish the course by Friday.  Fingers crossed.
